**vue typescript rails oo-pattern**

this stuff is just a scaffolding template from [vue typescript starter](https://github.com/alexjoverm/Vue-Typescript-Starter) and adding some entity and service.
entity can do validation in form with [class-validator](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator) and can be serialize,deserialize with [cerialize](https://github.com/weichx/cerialize).

before install this you must change the username and password of the database.yml on directory ***rails-for-vue-ts-starter\config\database.yml*** based on your postgresql user & password

in this project i use postgreSQL v10.0 with node js v8.90
